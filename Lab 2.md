**Lab 2**

Lab 2 in the CMTH 642 course at Ryerson University was designed to teach aspiring data scientists how to create and determine when to use t-tests and chi squared tests.

**T Test**

T-test is a statistic that is used to determine the significance, if any, between the means of two groups which could or could not be related in certain features. A t-test looks at the t-statistic value and the degree of freedom to determine the probability of difference between two sets of data. It is mostly used when the data sets follow a normal distribution.

**Chi Squared Test**

Chi-squared test is used to test relationships between categorical variables. The null hypothesis to a Chi squared test is that there is no relationship between variables

To begin I would recommend reading the PDF file that explains each question and why it is done.
